A few things I draw in Madrid: the city of cats.

Believe it or not, last time I enter that door, It took me about a decade to exit back! Beware of mathematics, folks. They are kind of addictive. You'd better follow your passion for arts!

They say, you need to have at least 4 grandparents born in Madrid to be a __cat__. I'm not. That might be 
why this cat looks rabbit-ish.

I wonder what does She thinks? Mentally re-viewing next week errands? Something wrong in her work?
Is She just watching T.V.? Someone speaking out of the frame? 

At least, this time I like the proportions! Happy days!
