Starting the year with some trees and bricks

<!-- excerpt -->

A little study to start the year slow:

## All sorts of trees

I really don't like the ball tree (<code>viii</code>), despite I know it's popular. I tink 
<code>vii</code> and <code>x</code> are better. But, that wasn't the point.

Brick patterns. I like the irregular one

The top-rank it's easier with bricks: <code>i</code> and <code>iii</code> are clear winners. 


Anyway, It has taken some time to start after Christmas. I drew, but publishing... I've procrastinated a bit, I admit.

This year I should put more time on these studies. Everybody recommends 
it to see real improvements, don't they? So, why not?
