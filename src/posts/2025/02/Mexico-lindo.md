Things I draw in México!

<!-- excerpt -->

We started the year with a very nice trip to México. Spending about a week in [Saltillo Coah.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltillo) and a few days at Cancún.

I had time to draw. 

These are a few things I could capture with my pencils: 

## Saltillo Pa'lante!

By far, my best discover of the trip. The place totally exceeded my (rather low) expectations.

Despite I think Saltillo needs a decent public transport system (and it needs it fast!) it has lots to offer. Don't let locals confuse you when they call it "Salti-ranch", it is totally a city. But one that still feels cozy and warm. 

You can shoot air-rifles (while drinking beer!) here, eat great tacos at "Los pioneros", discover real burritos, bowling, drink, _huevonear_ at "Plaza de los huevones",looking through de _water eye_... Overall, it reminds me my childhood at Alcorcón, that was very nice.

Do yourself a favour and give Saltillo a chance!

Somehow magnetic in its emptiness. I discover Biznagas here!

## OXXO: a la vuelta de tu vida.

It's everywhere. Mexicans love it. And we discover there is actually two types of [OXXO's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxxo):

It let me down a bit though. But, ey, it is a true institution in México

## All included at Cancún.

Way more famous by far, Cancún didn't surprise me that much. It's nice, it's all inclusive, hotels are top, beaches are great... But it you change _gringos_ by our _guiris_ it feels totally like southern Europe.

I took my chance to draw a few beach scenes, without the beach itself!
