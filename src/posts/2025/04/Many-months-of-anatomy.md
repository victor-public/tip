Many months drawing anatomy, so far.

<!-- excerpt -->

A few months ago, I broke my arm. An accident with my new bike. You know what they say... 
there are only two types of cyclists: those who have had an accident, and those who 
didn't, already. I'm one of the lucky ones now.

I took two weeks of sick leave (for the first time in decades!) and, I was soooo bored. Bored to 
death. So, I drop by the local book store, and grab some drawing textbooks. 

"Essential human anatomy for artists" by Ken Goldman, was promising. And it is the one I've been using since then. It's quite good in terms of anatomy-theory. But I feel it lacks practical explanations on how to actually draw the examples.

## The good ones

## The not-so-good ones

        And, the inevitable blunders

There is still a long road ahead! I should practice more, read more. But... I also need to find 
a way to learn these practical _tips & tricks_ Maybe... maybe, It's time to joing a course IRL!
