Get back to work: cows & cups!

<!-- excerpt -->

## A cup on a table

This is a typical study drawing. I bought a (fantastic book) with many examples of 
still alives and instructions on how to proceed: how to setup a mini studio, lightning, 
progressive mockups... 

This time I decided to draw the _cup example_. We've enjoyed some sunny weather 
in Dublin lately. One of this rare occassions! And I just wanted to practice while 
I have some quiet time at the balcony.

## A cow on the grass

I draw this cow on a different day. Very late at night, after work. I had been reading 
about different ways of applying shadows. Cross-hatching took my fance, and... I tried. 

No models this time. I decided for a cow for no reason. Or... who knows maybe something on the back
of my mind was mooooooing!
