New year, new resolutions. I come back to the pens, brushes, drawings, and sketches. And I gave  watercolors a second chance.

This time... Penguins!

Weather is absolutly freezing in Dublin these days. Christmas has been great: just the two of us. But... at the same time... I felt blue sometimes. First time in years I couldn't visit family and friends.

On the bright side... that gave time to paint again. To paint my blue, like this quiet wave of ice at the bottom. 

Ah! I wish I could have had cosy time in Madrid. But... It is for a good cause. The best cause!
