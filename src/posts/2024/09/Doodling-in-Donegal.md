I saw a sea horse in Donegal

<!-- excerpt -->

A trip to Donegal is not an easy thing: wake up really early (I mean, __really__ early) in the morning, 
find your way to Connolly, find  your bus then... wait long hours. 

But, wait... Wait!? No! You can use these hours to doodle what you see.

## Apples are scary in Donegal

## The trip was so long, you miss your games

## Go Dutch, go dutch!

Such a nice trip.
