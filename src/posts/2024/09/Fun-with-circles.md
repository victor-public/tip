Creativity exercises

<!-- excerpt -->

One of the first things I tried was an Udemy course. A course from __Antonio García 
Villarán__. It seems it's not available anymore, but I manage to access using my 
company's Udemy :)

It's quite good. One of the first exercises is about creativity. Take a simple shape: 
circles, squares, crosses... and draw them into something else. 

<figure class="text-center mb-6">

<caption>A circle turns to whom you are going to call</caption>
</figure>

It is surprising how much creativiy sparks from such a simple exercise. This is just 
one example. 

See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLt66I45GG0" target="__blank">Antonio</a>? Self-driven (not self-taught) is possible!
