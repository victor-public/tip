This is St Patrick's tower. Let's fix it back!

<!-- excerpt -->

[A Liberties landmark](https://libertiesdublin.ie/a-liberties-landmark-st-patricks-tower/) sited right in front of my gym's gates. It dominates and hosts a _not-so-hidden_ caf√©.

It used to be a windmill, but it lost its blades long ago. Maybe, I though, we could fix it back!

St James Cathedral is close to the tower. They organize the Celtic Camino. That makes it a 
great start for your journey. From here to Santiago, and go the extra mile finishing at 
Finisterre's lighthouse.

From tower to tower, end to end.

Hand-work under the Irish pale Sun. Blues, grays, earths and patience. Ironically, I could 
paint a windmill, because the wind was quiet.

And, yes. I know. It's not a perfect representation. But... Who cares! I enjoyed 
the painting: Let's grab a pint!
