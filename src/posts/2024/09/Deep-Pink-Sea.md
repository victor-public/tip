Coming from the deep, delicious with paprika

<!-- excerpt -->

One of my first oils, ah... I remember the day: nice bright sun in Dublin, cold beer,
a podcast in the background and lots of crimson tubes!

By that time, I was still looking for a place to buy canvases. Actually, a place to 
build _cheap_ canvases in Dublin. Thus I took an odd choice: __oil on paper__ I like 
the brushstrokes, crimson color turning to pink, the blue on the backround...

True, I admit: it is not perfect. But my mind was flying high! Fair enough for a first work. Practice makes perfect _I'm going to be the next [Vel√°zquez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez) in no time_!

Ah... I'm such a fool!
