These feet are made for walking!

<!-- excerpt -->

Feelling a bit better by November after _broken-arm_ October. 

I kept studying anatomy. I spent quite a few hours drawing in 
charcoal: noses, eyes, hands (terrible results with hands. They are **very** 
difficult!) and some naked figures. 

Basically I've enjoyed the great "_indoors_". Cup of coffe, safe from Dublin's wheather, in summary, good activity. 

My best so far are feet:

<img src="/assets/img/posts/11_feet_all.jpg" alt="All the feet I know, all the feet I know!..." />
<caption>
All the feet I know, all the feet I know!...

</figure>

I still struggle to keep a consistent quality. But, ey, little disclaimer here: I'm using a notebook who's being living on the balcony for about a year, without any protection. Maybe not the best support...
