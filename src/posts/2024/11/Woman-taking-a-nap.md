Oh! She looks so peaceful...

<!-- excerpt -->

The idea comes from my anatomy book and it's simple: 
**just draw a single line, capturing the shape as close as possible to the original 
model** 

Simple... but not that much. It drove me into a frenetic cycle of erase-draw, erase-draw, 
and so on. And, I couldn't help but adding darks and a little more realistic twist.

But I enjoyed painting this. And, honestly, I think the results are good. It's not only me! 
When I publish the follow-up post on socials, _they censored it because of the nude!_ That speaks 
good about the result, I'd say.

Oh, my dear puritans. 

Either way, there are certain parts I like more than others. And to learn (to truly learn) you 
need criticism. I have my family and friends, sure. But I though a bit of self-assesment wouldn't hurt 
either. There it goes:

The good parts!

1. That combination of breast, arms around the face: it was very difficult. But I think it looks good.
2. The belly and its volume!

The not-so-good parts!

1. I know, I know. It seems some one axe-cut her feet.
2. And that knee... What were you thinking about, uh?
3. An easy one I missed: the floor is NOT aligned!

See you in the next post!
