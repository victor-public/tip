It's Christmas, after all. And I tried with trees, snow, sweets... I didn't like 
any, until there was the light.

This time, I first rehearsh; drawing a separate sketch in charcoal before going into full pastell colors. 

The good part about it is, I found a proper use for one of my tools. I bought a set of pencils a few weeks ago. They came 
with some extra tools, including a brush who also drops water. I've been trying to use it for solid colors in the 
background, or to degrade shadows... The results were poor. But, look at this bubbles on the candle body!

On the other hand, I'm getting a bit more confident with pastells. Maybe because this is my second time with 
this color scheme. Anyways, overall, I'm happy with the results:

I hope this candle lights your Christmas up, folks! And happy new year.
