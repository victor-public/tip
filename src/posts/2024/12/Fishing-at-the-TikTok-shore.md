Some pastell ideas I copied from art-Tok.

<!-- excerpt -->

From left to right: basic tone colouring, about an hour of adding orange, gray, 
white and black pastell. And the final result. Look at the tiny fisherman on the 
bottom-right.

Yes: **He is fishing dinosaurs in a sea of lava. What else?**

The original idea comes from TikTok, and it was painted using oil bars. Actually, 
before this one I tried this drawing with a set of oil pastells I bouth at _Mr 
Price_ But it was a total disaster. Would you buy  art stuff at _Mr. Price_ again? Thanks, 
but no thanks! 

Tiktok is a fantastic source of inspiration. A very good resource to find nice 
topics for drawings, ideas to practice. Sadly, it's not that good producing persistent 
impressions: I forgot the author's name!
