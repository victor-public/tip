Piper's Corner, from the Luas Stop. Dublin.

<!-- excerpt -->

First, the sketch:

My take, on graphite pencils.

Not that bad, at this point. The buildings on the sides are different, and there 
are a few less people on the image. But, overall, I like the front of the 
Piper's Corner building. This letters... they are going to be difficult to paint!

Ah! Pencil colors are hard. The main in the stairs has almost dissapeared, and I'm 
not really happy with the result. Maybe I'm making this harder for myself. The pencils 
are actually watercolor pencils. And certainly I could have put more time on this.

But I enjoyed the process anyway. Also, at this point, I'm just trying as many 
things as I can. Which makes me wonder... 

Shall I buy some real watercolors?
