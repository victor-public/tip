Shilouettes and legs. Eyes and the failed nose!

<!-- excerpt -->

So you want to _learn_ to paint, uh? Then you should study. 

That's why me (and my broken arm) sat down this morning with my brand new book: [Essential 
anatomy for artists!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128681328-essential-human-anatomy-for-artists)

Intrincate details on human anatomy, beautiful pages, drawing advice, and how to 
setup the workspace, utensils... It may not be the best book in the work, but frankly 
I'm happy with the purchase. 

I spent a good few hours copying everyting I saw in the first chapter:

<caption>Boxing the human body, they say...</caption>
</figure>

<caption>If not perfect, call it body positive...</caption>
</figure>

<figure class="text-center flex justify-center flex-col">
<img src="/assets/img/posts/10_legs.png" alt="This legs are made for walking" />
<caption>I like this one. These legs are made for walking!</caption>
</figure>

I should have stop at this point, to be honest. Stop drawing and use these legs to run away... Instead, 
I kept drawing hands, noses...

<img src="/assets/img/posts/10_nose.png" alt="A not-a-nose?" />
<caption>That was suppouse to be a nose. Oh! My!!</caption>
</figure>

It's a learning process at the end. Also, to learn **when do you have to stop**
