## Who Am I? What do I do?

Yay! I'm painting!

A 2024's new year resolution, I started doddling on January, charcoal, colour pencils... Eventually, I discover I love it. I
got a bit deeper into it: oils, pastells, watching tons of youtube's art. But, then, stagnation. I started to feel 
I needed a boost, motivation. Then I read about an [internet trend](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) and I wonder...

>> Ey, that smells like the good old internet (please: _don't like, do not subscribe_) when things were done for the shake of it. It could be _my_ thing too. A little extra motivation.

So, that's the thing: here I am, __learning to paint in public__ I'll be publishing my draws here, from the most 
horrible attempts to do something nice, to the spare piece I feel satisfied with. From Bluebell to the world!

And now... a little bit of the boring stuff:
