## Who Am I? What do I do?

I'm __VÃ­ctor Santiago__ and I'm painting!

A 2024's new year resolution, I started doddling on January. Charcoal, colour pencils, pastells, canvases, oil and turpentine became my treats.... And YouTube, lots of arty videos. I love it!

Then, stagnation. I started to feel I needed a boost, motivation. Then I read about the [next-big-idea](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) on the internet, and I wonder...

<br>

>> Ey! that smells like the good old internet (please: _don't like, do not subscribe_) when things were done for the sake of it. <br> <br> It could be _my_ thing too. A little extra motivation.

<br>

So, that's it: here I am, __learning to paint in public__ I'll be publishing my draws here, from the most 
horrible attempts to do something nice, to the spare piece I feel satisfied with. 

From Bluebell to the world! With love.

And now... the boring stuff:
